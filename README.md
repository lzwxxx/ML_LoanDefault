### Problem Statement: 

#### Disadvantages of traditional credit scoring methods:

Limited Scope: Only considers one’s credit history, does not consider their overall financial situation and creditworthiness, individual circumstances that can affect one’s ability to repay loans are not considered

Unfairness: Certain groups may be unfairly penalised by the scoring methods (those with limited or no credit history)

### Motivation: 

Inclusivity: Alternative credit scoring methods can be more inclusive and provide credit opportunities to those who would otherwise be excluded.

Increase accuracy of traditional credit scoring methods: Alternative credit scoring methods take into account a wider range of data beyond credit history, which provides a more accurate picture of one’s creditworthiness
